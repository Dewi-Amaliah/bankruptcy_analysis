# Preliminary Data Analysis


Before carrying out further analysis of the data, let us conduct some preliminary data analysis. From the summary shown below, we can see that the data is a high dimensional dataset with 21 variables, out of which 6 are character variables and 15 are numeric variables.


```{r prelim-skimr}
skimr::skim(bankruptcy)
```

It can be observed that there are quite a number of empty values present in `FirmEnd` which are essentially `NULL` values. Therefore, we have converted these into`NA` values. 

```{r prelim-firmend}
bankruptcy <- bankruptcy %>%
  mutate(FirmEnd = ifelse(FirmEnd == "", 
                          NA, 
                          FirmEnd))
```

The data credibility issues are checked by confirming if the `DaysIn`, `EmplUnion`, `Employees`, `HeadCourtCityToDE`,`MonthFiled`, `YearFiled` and `HeadCityPop` are non-negative values. It was found that there are observations where the `EmplUnion` values are more than `Employees` which was removed from the data and that certain companies have 1 Employee and 1 EmplUnion values as shown below, which is suspicious but since there is not any concrete evidence that these observations pose data credibility issues, these observations were not excluded for the analysis. 

```{r}
bankruptcy%>%
  filter(EmplUnion>=Employees)%>%
  select(Name,Employees,EmplUnion)

bankruptcy <-  bankruptcy %>%
filter(Name != "Promus Companies Inc. (Harrahs Jazz Co. only)")
```


We noticed that `SICMajGroup`,the industry classification code,has a lengthy name, therefore in order to keep it more identifiable, the code was separated into a new factor variable `SIC` and its meaning in the `SICMajGroup`. 

```{r prelim-sic}
glimpse(bankruptcy)
bankruptcy <- bankruptcy %>%
  separate(SICMajGroup, 
           into = c("SIC", "SICMajGroup"), 
           sep = "\\s", 
           extra = "merge") %>%
  mutate(SIC = as.factor(SIC))
```

We can see in the data summary that some of the numeric variables in the data such as `DaysIn`, `Ebit`, `Employees`,`EmplUnion`, `HeadCourtCityToDE`, `Liab` and `Sales` have numerous missing values. The missing values in the data has been visualized as shown in \@ref(fig:prelim-vismiss). Throughout our strategy, we have tried to retain the data as much as possible while maintaining high data quality and credibility. 

It can be observed that `FirmEnd` has the highest number of missing values, followed by `EmplUnion`. The strategy employed is to remove the variables `FirmEnd` and `EmplUnion`. As the variable `FirmEnd` depicts the description of the end of Firm's existance , it doesn't provide significant value to the analysis and it can be excluded. Similarly `EmplUnion` is removed due to the fact that `Employees` and `EmplUnion` are closely related and `EmplUnion` is be a subset of `Employees`, therefore removing `EmplUnion` which has too many missing values would not affect our analysis significantly as the variable Employees explains similar aspect. 

```{r prelim-vismiss, fig.cap="Overview of missing values in the data"}
vis_miss(bankruptcy)+
  ggtitle("Missing values in the Data")


bankruptcy<- bankruptcy%>%
  select(-FirmEnd,-EmplUnion)
```

On further investigation, it was observed that there are 4 companies whose values for `DaysIn` are missing. Based on the publicly available data, values were encoded for **AP Industries** and **Daisy Systems Corp.** (See Appendix for more information). However, the data for **Hunt International Resources Corp.** and **McCrory Corp.** was not available, therefore we have imputed the variable, based on median of the `DaysIn` in the industry classification they belong to.

```{r prelim-daysin}
na_daysin <- filter(bankruptcy, is.na(DaysIn))
na_daysin%>%
  select(c(Name,DaysIn))%>%
  kableExtra::kable()%>%
  kableExtra::kable_paper()
```

```{r}
median_daysin<- bankruptcy %>% group_by(SIC) %>%
  summarise(median = median(DaysIn, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
    dplyr::filter(SIC %in% c(20, 53))
```


```{r prelim-daysinimpute}
bankruptcy <- bankruptcy %>%
  mutate(DaysIn = ifelse(Name == "Hunt International Resources Corp.", 305,
                                    ifelse(Name == "AP Industries, Inc.", 121,
                                           ifelse(Name == "Daisy Systems Corp.", 1944,
                                                  ifelse(Name == "McCrory Corp.", 683, DaysIn)))))

summary(bankruptcy$DaysIn)



```

The summary statistics of the variable after imputation, suggests no suspicious outliers or anomalies as the bankruptcy can be a lengthy ordeal. 


The missing values in `HeadCourtCityToDE` shown in the table below, are imputed using the values in `CityFiled`, `DENYOther`, and `HeadStAtFiling`. Considering the publicaly available data on headquarter address and the `CityFiled`, the distances between these cities were found and imputed into the data accordingly. See Appendix for more information.   
 

```{r prelim-headquart}
na_distance <- bankruptcy %>%
  filter(is.na(HeadCourtCityToDE))

na_distance%>%
  select(Name,HeadCourtCityToDE,CityFiled,DENYOther,HeadStAtFiling)%>%
  kableExtra::kable()%>%
  kableExtra::kable_paper()
```

```{r}
bankruptcy <- bankruptcy %>%
  mutate(HeadCourtCityToDE = ifelse(Name == "Divi Hotels, N.V.", 1126,
                                    ifelse(Name == "Loewen Group, Inc.", 2942,
                                           ifelse(Name == "Philip Services Corp. (1999)", 1234,
                                                  HeadCourtCityToDE))))

summary(bankruptcy$HeadCourtCityToDE)

bankruptcy%>%
  filter(HeadCourtCityToDE==1)%>%
  select(Name,HeadCourtCityToDE,CityFiled,DENYOther,HeadStAtFiling)%>%
  kableExtra::kable()%>%
  kableExtra::kable_paper()
```


Exploring the summary statistics, it was observed that the minimum distance is 1 , when inspected the state of headquarters and the city filed is in the same state therefore it does not pose a data credibility issue. 

With regards to the `Employees` variable, it was observed that there is a single observation that is missing data on its employees. Under closer examination of the `Sales` Variable, we observed that it was the same firm that had missing data on `Sales` as well. On closer inspection of this firm, the presence of missing values on the variable `Ebit` was also found, therefore we remove this observation considering the fact that this single observation has missing values of these three variables.

 
   
```{r}
na_sales <- filter(bankruptcy, is.na(Sales))
na_employees <- filter(bankruptcy, is.na(Employees))
options(scipen = 999)
bankruptcy%>%
  filter(Name=="County Seat, Inc.")%>%
  select(Name,Sales,Employees,Ebit)

bankruptcy<- bankruptcy%>%
  filter(!is.na(Sales))


```


The missing values in `Liab` and `Ebit` was treated by dropping the missing observations, as the missing values in each of the variables were below 10% and out of the 39 rows where either one of the two variables were missing, 8 of the observations have missing values on both `Liab` and `Ebit`. We believe it is more reasonable to drop the missing values than impute them as imputation could mislead the analysis.  

```{r}

all_liab_ebit_missing<- bankruptcy %>%
  filter(is.na(Ebit) |is.na(Liab))

bank_data_op1 <- bankruptcy %>%
  filter(!is.na(Ebit) & !is.na(Liab))
data_label <- bank_data_op1%>%
  filter(Ebit==max(Ebit)|Liab==max(Liab)|Sales==max(Sales)|Assets==max(Assets))%>%
  select(Name,Ebit,Liab,Sales,Assets)


```


`DENYOther`, `MonthFiled` and `YearFiled` ought to be factor as mentioned in the data description therefore are converted to factor from numeric variables as shown in figure \@ref(fig:cleandata)

```{r cleandata, fig.cap="Overview of Cleaned Data"}

data_clean <- bank_data_op1 %>%
  mutate(DENYOther = as.factor(DENYOther),
         MonthFiled = as.factor(MonthFiled),
         YearFiled = as.factor(YearFiled))
row.names(data_clean) <- data_clean$Name
vis_dat(data_clean)

```

The data was then checked for outliers, even though we haven't found suspicious outliers in majority of the variables (see Appendix for more information), outliers were found in `Ebit`, `Liab` , `Assets` and `Sales` as shown below in figure \@ref(fig:prelimoutlier-1) and \@ref(fig:prelimoutlier-2). Interestingly, these values belong to a single firm called **Texaco Inc.** This will be discussed further in the sections below.


```{r prelimoutlier-1, fig.cap="Presence of Outliers in Sales and Assests"}
p3 <- data_clean%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Sales),fill="blue",alpha=0.7)+
    geom_text(data=data_label,aes(x=Sales,y=50,label=Name),
    hjust = 0.7, size = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("Sales")+
  ylab("Count")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

p1<- data_clean%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Ebit),fill="blue",alpha=0.7)+
  geom_text(data=data_label,aes(x=Ebit,y=50,label=Name),
    hjust = 0.7, size = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("Ebit")+
  ylab("Count")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

p2 <- data_clean%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Liab),fill="blue",alpha=0.7)+
  geom_text(data=data_label,aes(x=Liab,y=50,label=Name),
    hjust = 0.7, size = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("Liab")+
  ylab("Count")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))

p4 <- data_clean%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Assets),fill="blue",alpha=0.7)+
  geom_text(data=data_label,aes(x=Assets,y=50,label=Name),
    hjust = 0.7, size = 4)+
  theme_bw()+
  ggtitle("Assets")+
  ylab("Count")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))


p3+p4

```


```{r prelimoutlier-2,fig.cap="Presence of Outliers in Ebit and Liab"}
p1+p2

```



In order to gain insights from the data, we have further explored it.Below shown is a correlation plot. It is clear from the plot that `HeadCityPop`and `HeadCourtCityToDE` have no correlation with any of the other variables. Therefore, we omit these two variables from further analysis. 



```{r}
A = cor(data_clean%>%select_if(is.numeric))
corrplot::corrplot(A, method = 'number')

data_clean<- data_clean%>%
  select(-HeadCityPop,-HeadCourtCityToDE)

```
